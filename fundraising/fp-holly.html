                        <b>UPDATE ON HOLLY</b>: This poor cat caught on video being thrown and hit hard by a rock (photo of the rock included) by a cruel person remains confined and on intensive care at Vetlink Vet Clinic. While her condition was critical the first time she was brought to the clinic, she has improved and is now eating on her own.
                        Her head titling is still observed but has lessen. She still has shallow breathing, most probablye due to her diaphragmatic hernia. If her condition continues to improve, she will soon be scheduled for surgery —  diaphragmatic hernia repair.
                        Please pray for the continuous healing and successful operation of Holly. May she be given a second chance at a better life. <br> <br>
                    
                        <b>ABOUT THE CASE</b>: SWS is on the process of filing a case against the one who abused and hurt Holly. We already visited the police station with the reporter as complainant and have prepared all needed documents and evidence. Today is the third day to visit the police station and hopefully, later, the case will be filed before the fiscal.
                        As both the vetting and legal process will cost high, we seek your support for Holly. Please pray for her healing and justice! Thank you and God bless! <br> </p>
                    <p class="petnamestory-label"> Holly's Story </p>
                    <p class="petname-story"> 
                        It was fellow advocate Rhiki Tiktak who messaged me for help with this poor cat from Holy Spirit, QC. 
                        He sent me a video showing a man throwing a rock on the cat in full force. My chest wanted to burst in anger from what little 
                        I saw since I cannot even finish watching it. Rhiki requested SWS to handle the vetting while he talks to some people 
                        about the legal remedies. We agreed. <br> <br>
                        January 16 of 2025, rescuer Jun picked up this poor cat that was fighting for her life. It seemed like it 
                        is having difficulty breathing. Holly was brought to Vetlink Vet Clinic for urgent medical attention. 
                        She is negative for the panleukopenia virus (FPV). <br> <br>
                        However, most probably due to the abuse and trauma she received, Holly sustained a diaphragmatic hernia (as x-ray showed) 
                        and there is observed head titling, indicating possible pain in the head. Holly is currently in critical condition, 
                        please pray for her survival. <br> <br>
                        She is now on IV fluids and medications/treatment all meant to try to save her life. 
                        Her CBC test results showed normal WBC, RBC and PLT but elevated lymphocytes and monocytes due to inflammation resulting 
                        from the trauma she sustained.
                        We will keep followers posted of Holly’s condition and the legal actions that will be taken. 
                        Should none materialize from Rhiki’s end, SWS will be the one to file a case against the culprit. 
                        We just hope witnesses will also cooperate as many of the cases we file or wanted to file become unsuccessful 
                        due to their failure or refusal to participate. <br> <br>
                        Please pray for the survival of poor Holly. She is really in pain and suffering. 
                        May we also request those with extra to share to please donate for her vetting and possible legal expenses. 
                        We are on hold with rescues due to lack of funds but we simply cannot turn a blind eye on this abused cat. 
                        We need your support badly. Thank you and may God be with us always! <br> </p>
